#One

This is me documenting how to add a new post to the site. There isn't much to it.

1. Add a new folder under /src/pages that is (will be) the name of the pages slug in kebab case. E.g., `adding-a-post`.
1. Inside of the new folder add a file named index.md.
1. Add three fields of metadata to the top of the page with 3 dashes above and below like below. I'm not sure yet if the 3 dashes are nedessary.

4. Below the bottom 3 dashes, start adding content markdown

**Your done!**
