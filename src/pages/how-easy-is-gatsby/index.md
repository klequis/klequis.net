My original blog was hosted on a friends server that I administered for him. I always intended to move it off but never got to it. He decomissioned the server and my blog hasen't been live since. That is partly time but also I didn't want to have another Wordpress site. What I did want was something like Gatsby that would read markdown files, but never got around to that either ... until I found Dan Abramov's blog which is built with Gatsby. Armed with this as a starting point and the [very excellent tutorial on Gatsby's website](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/) I was up and running in a day.
