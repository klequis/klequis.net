My original blog was hosted on a friends server that I administered for him. I always intended to move it off but never got to it. He decomissioned the server and my blog hasen't been live since. That is partly time but also I didn't want to have another Wordpress site. What I did want was a system that would read read markdown files hosted in GitHub repositories, but that also seemed more time than I had ... until I found [Dan Abramov's blog](https://overreacted.io) which is built with Gatsby. Armed with this as a starting point and the [very excellent tutorial on Gatsby's website](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/) I was up and running in less than two days.

The two days was made-up of the following
- Going through the Gatsby tutorial so I knew how things worked
- Deciding on a color scheme for the site and implementing
- Deciding on and implementing a syntax highlight color scheme
- and some miscellaneous stuff I don't remember

So, in a way, I don't really know how easy or hard Gatsby is since all I did was build the site in the tutorial and then fork & modify someone else's site. However, my impression is that if you are a React person, Gatsby will be pretty easy for you.
