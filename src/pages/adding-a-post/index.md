This is the blog system I wanted to create but didn't have time to figure out how to get it working.

# Adding A Post
It was pretty easy to add a post by cloaning an existing one and changing a few details. Let's try some code:

```js
const sayHello = (name) => {
    console.log(`Hello ${name}`)
}

sayHello('Carl')
```
That is really cool!
